While the opposition claims the fate of the project is still uncertain and that insufficient information has been shared with the public, the Turkish government states that 12,500 hectares of land where a pilot farm will be established and 780,500 hectares to be allocated for the investment of private Turkish companies have not been transferred due to the change of government in Sudan in 2019 and the pandemic, adding that no payment has been made to the Sudanese since the land has not yet been leased.",https://farmlandgrab.org/post/view/30880,2022-04-19 02:30:00,Turkey's ambitious project in Sudan turns into a fiasco
